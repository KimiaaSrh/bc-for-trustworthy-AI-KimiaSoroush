Based on our [thesis proposal](https://cri.pantheonsorbonne.fr/sites/default/files/2024-04/sujet_these_2024-2027-salinesi_herbaut_0.pdf), write a draft of the methodology section of the planned Systematic Literature Review, following the methodology proposed in the paper [Kitchenham, Barbara, et al. "Systematic literature reviews in software engineeringâ€“a systematic literature review." Information and Software Technology 51.1](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Barbara-Kitchenham/publication/302924724_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_Software_Engineering/links/61712932766c4a211c03a6f7/Guidelines-for-performing-Systematic-Literature-Reviews-in-Software-Engineering.pdf).

You should at least provide the following elements:

- Motivation
- Research Questions
- Search query based on a meta-search engine, such as (Scopus)[scholar.miage.dev]
- Inclusion/Exclusion criteria
- Review protocol

Results should be sent as a pull request on this repository and should not exceed 3 pages in the (IEEE conference format)[https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html], including references. You can use [this repo](https://github.com/nherbaut/pandoc-ieee-springer-conference-template) to write in markdown instead of latex.

You must not use any generative AI tools to produce the content.
